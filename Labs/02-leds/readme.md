# Lab 2: Control of GPIO, LED, push button

### Learning objectives

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to learn how to use basic input/output devices such as LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) and push buttons, and how to control GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins with help of control registers.

## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

Draw two basic ways to connect a LED to the output pin of the microcontroller: LED active-low, LED active-high. What is the name of the LED pin that is connected to the microcontroller in each case?

| **LED color** | **Supply voltage** | **LED current** | **LED voltage** | **Resistor value** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| red | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 2 | 150 ? |
| blue | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 4 | 50 ?|



Draw the basic ways to connect a push button to the microcontroller input pin: button active-low, button active-high.

A detailed description of working with input/output ports can be found in [ATmega328P datasheet](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega328p) in section I/O-Ports.

Use the datasheet to find out the meaning of the DDRB and PORTB control register values and their combinations.

| **DDRB** | **Description** |
| :-: | :-- |
| 0 | Input pin |
| 1 | Output pin|

| **PORTB** | **Description** |
| :-: | :-- |
| 0 | Output low value |
| 1 | Output high value |

| **DDRB** | **PORTB** | **Direction** | **Internal pull-up resistor** | **Description** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- |
| 0 | 0 | input | no | Tri-state, high-impedance |
| 0 | 1 | input | yes | Tri-state, high-impedance  |
| 1 | 0 | output | no | Output low (sink) |
| 1 | 1 | output | no | Output high (source) |

See [schematic of Arduino Uno board](../../Docs/arduino_shield.pdf) in docs folder of Digital-electronics-2 repository and find out which pins of ATmega328P can be used as input/output pins. To which pin is the LED L connected? (PB5) Is it connected as active-low or active-high?(Active high)
